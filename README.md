## NYU_IDM_COVID19_modeling

New York University Grossman School of Medicine and Institue of Disease Modeling have been collaborating with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to project COVID-19 epidemics and health system burden in New York City, NY, US. This repository includes reguarly updated reports on COVID-19 projections since April 2020. 

The model contributors include: 
NYU Grossman School of Medicine: Scott Braithwaite, Anna Bershteyn, Hae-Young Kim, Jessica Mcgillen <br/>
Institute of Disease Modeling: Dan Klein, Niket Thakkar, Prashanth Selvaraj

## Latest Update: October 24, 2020
We have updated the projections for NYC COVID-19 epidemic and hospital burdens under the three potential scenarios (optimistic, mid-range, or pessimistic). In NYC, recent growth in cases in September and October was largely confined to specific neighborhoods (i.e. "hotspots"). If hotspots can achieve summer-level effective reproduction number (Re), the epidemic will stabilize but at a higher setpoint. If hotspots adhere to precautions, which will bring down Re <1, there will be only transient increases in SARS-CoV-2 in hotspots and city-wide, soon declining to pre-hotspot levels. However, if Re remains >1 due to changes such as weather and school/work/social habits, outbreaks will become increasingly common, with epidemic growth expected on average.
